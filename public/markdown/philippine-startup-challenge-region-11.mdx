Comon** – were crowned **Champions** at the **Davao City Startup Pitching Competition** of DICT Region 11 on September 6, 2024, as part of the **Philippine Startup Challenge 9!** 

Held at the **MARIAN TBI - University of Immaculate Conception**, this competition brought together the brightest minds from Davao City, showcasing innovative solutions to real-world challenges. With 18 teams from various schools and universities fiercely competing, the stakes were high, and our officers' dedication truly shone through.

Now, these exceptional individuals are gearing up for the next stage – the **Regional Pitching Competition** – where they will continue to represent **Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao** and push the boundaries of innovation. Their journey is a testament to the power of creativity, hard work, and teamwork.

Let’s give them a huge round of applause for this incredible achievement and wish them the best of luck as they take on the next level of competition! We can’t wait to see what they accomplish next.
