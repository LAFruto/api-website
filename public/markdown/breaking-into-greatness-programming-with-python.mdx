# Workshop Recap: "Breaking into Greatness: Programming in Python"

On February 3, 2024, the "Breaking into Greatness: Programming in Python" workshop series was held, offering participants the opportunity to delve into specialized Python programming tailored to their specific academic needs. With sessions aligned with three distinct areas — Theoretical Studies, Data Science, and Game Development — the event aimed to provide a comprehensive learning experience for participants from various disciplines. The following sections highlight the key activities and outcomes for each department.

## 1. Theoretical Studies Department: Advancing Computational Understanding

Held at the OSS Learning Commons, 2nd floor, ADMIN Building, the workshop for the Theoretical Studies department focused on the foundational aspects of Python programming, essential for students in the College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS). The session covered key theoretical concepts, such as algorithms, data structures, and logic,

Participants engaged in rigorous discussions and hands-on exercises, which helped them understand the significance of Python in theoretical computer science. The workshop also highlighted Python’s versatility and its potential application in solving complex computational problems. The session aimed to strengthen participants' grasp of programming fundamentals.

## 2. Data Science Department: Navigating Data-Driven Innovations

The Data Science workshop, hosted in Room 312, 3rd floor, ACAD Building, catered specifically to the College of Health Sciences (CHS). This session was designed to introduce participants to Python’s role in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Throughout the day, attendees explored various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, gaining entry-level experience in data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling.
